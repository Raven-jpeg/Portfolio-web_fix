      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello there! I'm Raven, an undergrad graphic designer from Viet Nam, now in Toronto for school to expand my creativity.
        Creating work that touches people's hearts and heals the inner child inside everyone is my goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nostalgia plays a big role in my work—it’s something we turn to when times are tough, whether for comfort,
        motivation, or simply to escape reality for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I’ve grown through experimentation, inspiration, and connecting with people both online and in person.
        Now, I’m excited to share my journey with you.
      </p>

    <h3>Inspiration & Fun Facts</h3>
    <p>
      I draw inspiration from music, video games, and the world around me.
      My biggest muse is summer—the warmth makes small joys like cold drinks or air conditioning feel extra rewarding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fun fact: This website is heavily inspired by the video game
      <strong>Doki Doki Literature Club!</strong>, one of my all-time favorites.
